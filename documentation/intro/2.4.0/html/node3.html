X10 basics
</H1>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00310000000000000000">
Core Object-oriented features</A>
</H1>
The core object-oriented features of X10  are very similar to those of Java or C#.

<P>
A program consists of a collection of top-level compilation units
(``unit'' for short).  A unit is either a <EM>class</EM>, a <EM>struct</EM>
or an <EM>interface</EM>.  

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="458" HEIGHT="179" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
package examples;
import x10.io.Console;
public class Hello {
...
...'The answer is: ''+result);
}
public def run():Boolean=true;
}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
Classes, structs and interfaces live in <EM>packages</EM> (e.g.
<TT>examples</TT> above). Packages typically consist of a sequence of 
identifiers separated by ``<TT>.</TT>'' (with no spaces). 

<P>
Packages are used to control access to top-level units. If they are
marked <TT>public</TT> they can be accessed from code in any other
package. If they have no accessibility modifier, they can be accessed
only by code living in the same package.

<P>
A file can contain multiple units - however only one of them may be
marked <TT>public</TT>. The name of the file must be the same as the name
of the <TT>public</TT> unit, with the suffix ``<TT>.x10</TT>''.

<P>

<P>
The <EM>fully qualified name</EM> (FQN) of a class, a struct or an interface is the
name of the class, the struct or the interface prefixed with the name
of the package 
that unit lives in. For instance, the FQN for the class above is <TT>examples.Hello</TT>. A unit <TT>A</TT> must use the FQN of another unit <TT>B</TT> unless it has an explicit <TT>import</TT> statement.

<P>
For instance:
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
import x10.io.Console;
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>
permits the name <TT>Console</TT> to be used in all the units
in the file without being qualified by the package name.

<P>
Packages are ``flat'' - importing a package <TT>x10</TT> does not imply
(for instance) that the package <TT>x10.examples</TT> is imported
automatically.  However, the name of a package is connected to the
directory structure of the code. All the units defined in a package
<TT>x10.examples</TT> must live in files in the directory <TT>  x10/examples</TT> (relative to some base directory). All the units
defined in the package <TT>x10</TT> must live in files in the directory
<TT>x10</TT>.  

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00311000000000000000">
Class</A>
</H2>

<P>
A class is a basic <EM>bundle</EM> of data and code. It specifies a number of
<EM>members</EM>, namely <EM>fields</EM>, <EM>methods</EM>, <EM>constructors</EM>,
and member classes and interfaces.  Additionally a class specifies the name of
another class from which it <EM>inherits</EM> (the <EM>superclass</EM>) and zero
or more interfaces which it <EM>implements</EM>. 

<P>
The members available at a class (i.e. that can be used by variables
whose type is that class) are those defined at a class, and those
defined in superclasses.

<P>
A class may be marked <TT>final</TT>. <TT>final</TT> classes cannot be subclassed.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00311100000000000000">
Fields</A>
</H3>

<P>
A field specifies a data item that belongs to the class:

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="487" HEIGHT="56" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
var nSolutions:Long = 0;
public static val expectedSolutions =...
..., 724, 2680, 14200, 73712, 365596, 2279184, 14772512];
val N:Long;
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
Fields may be mutable (<TT>var</TT>) or immutable (<TT>val</TT>). The type
of a mutable field must always be specified (it follows the name of
the variable, and a ``<TT>:</TT>''). A mutable field may or may not be
initialized.  The type of an immutable field may be omitted if the
field declaration specifies an <EM>initializer</EM>.  For instance, in
the above fragment the type <TT>Rail[Long]</TT> is inferred for the field
<TT>expectedSolutions</TT>. The value of an immutable field does not have
to be specified through an initializer - as long as it is supplied in
every constructor for the class. However, if an initializer is not
specified the type of the field must be specified.

<P>
Fields may be instance or static. By default fields are instance
fields, static fields are marked with the flag <TT>static</TT> (as
illustrated above). Every object has one copy of an instance
field. However, in each place, there is only one copy of each static field for all
instances of that class in the place. In X10  static fields are required to be
immutable.

<P>
Instance fields are inherited by subclasses. This means that an object
always has enough space for the instance fields of the class of which
the object is an instance, and all of the object's superclasses.

<P>
A field defined in a class may be <EM>shadowed</EM> in a subclass if the
subclass defines a field with the same name (but possibly a different
type). The value of a shadowed field can always be accessed by using
the qualifier <TT>super</TT>.

<P>
It is a compile-time error for a class to declare two fields with the
same name.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00311200000000000000"></A> <A NAME="x10-basic-properties"></A>
<BR>
Properties
</H3>
A class may specify one or more properties. Properties are immutable
instance fields that can be used in constrained types
sec:x10-basic-constrained-types.  They are also distinguished
from other instance fields in that they are initialized in a
particular way, through the invocation of a <TT>property</TT> call
during execution of the constructor sec:x10-basic-constructor for
the object or struct. It is a compile time error for a constructor to
have a normal execution path which does not contain a <TT>property</TT>
call. 

<P>
To make the compile-time type-checking of constraints more tractable,
X10 v&nbsp;2.4.0  requires 
that the types of properties are ``simpler'' than the type of the
class or struct they occur in. Specifically, the graph formed with
classes or structs as nodes and an edge from node <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$v$"> to node <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$w$"> if
the class or struct corresponding to <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$v$"> has a field whose base type
is <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$w$"> cannot have cycles. One consequence of this restriction is that
if a class or struct has a type parameter <TT>T</TT>, then the type of a
field cannot be <TT>T</TT>. 

<P>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00311300000000000000"></A><A NAME="x10-basic-methods"></A>
<BR>
Methods
</H3>

<P>
A method is a named piece of code, parametrized by zero or more
variables (the <EM>parameters</EM>). A method may be <TT>void</TT> - in
which case it returns no value and is usually called just for its
effect on the store - or it may return a value of a given type. 

<P>
A method may have one or more type parameters; such a method is said
to be <EM>type generic</EM>.  A method may have a <EM>method guard </EM>: the
guard may specify constraints on the type parameters. 

<P>

<P>
The <EM>signature</EM> of a method consists of its name and the types of
its arguments. A class may not contain two methods whose signatures
are the same. Additionally, a method specifies a <EM>return type</EM>.
and zero or more <EM>checked exceptions</EM> that the body of the method
is permitted to throw. (The body of the method may throw any number of
unchecked exceptions.)

<P>
A value <TT>e</TT> may be returned from the body of a method by executing
a <TT>return e;</TT> statement.  The return type of a method may be
inferred in X10  (that is, it does not need to be explicitly
supplied by the user).  It is the least upper bound of the types of
all expressions <TT>e</TT> where the body of the method contains a <TT>return e</TT> statement.

<P>
Methods may be <EM>instance</EM> methods or <EM>static</EM> methods. 
By default methods are instance methods. Methods are marked static by using 
the qualifier <TT>static</TT>.

<P>
Consider the code in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#table:NQueens-Board">2.1</A>.  The methods
<TT>safe(j:Long)</TT>, <TT>search(R:LongRange)</TT> and <TT>search()</TT>
are instance methods.  The instance methods of a class are available
for every object that is an instance of the class.  Instance methods
are invoked using the syntax <TT>e.m(e1,..., en)</TT>.  <TT>e</TT> is said
to be the <EM>receiver</EM> of the method invocation, and <TT>e1,...,en</TT>
the <EM>arguments</EM>.

<P>
Each expression in X10  has a <EM>static type</EM>(Section
&nbsp;sec:static-type).  The compiler reports an error when
processing a method invocation <TT>e.m(e1,..., en)</TT> if it cannot find
precisely one method named <TT>m</TT> on the static type of <TT>e</TT> which
has <TT>n</TT> arguments and which is such that the static type of <TT>  ei</TT> is a subtype of the declared type of the <TT>i</TT>th argument.

<BR>

<P>
The body of an instance method may access the state of the receiver
(called the <EM>current object</EM>) through the special variable <TT>  this</TT> (Line&nbsp;nqueens-board-search29).  Unless there is risk
of ambiguity, the prefix ``<TT>this.</TT>'' may be omitted; thus the
code can also be written as:  
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
def search() {
for (k in R) searchOne(k);
}
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>
The code for static methods does not have an associated current
object, and hence cannot use <TT>this</TT>. Static methods are invoked
by naming the class as the receiver, e.g. <TT>NQueens.main(null)</TT>.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00311310000000000000">
Inheritance</A>
</H4>
Methods may be inherited. That is, methods defined on superclasses are
available as methods on a subclass, unless they are overridden by
another method declaration with the same signature. Instance methods
are said to be <EM>virtually dispatched</EM>: this means that when a
method is invoked on an object <TT>o</TT> that is an instance of class
<TT>C</TT>, the inheritance tree for <TT>C</TT> is searched (starting from
<TT>C</TT>) for a method definition with the same signature. The first
definition found is executed. The type rules for X10  guarantee
that at runtime such a method will exist.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00311320000000000000">
Overloading</A>
</H4>
In X10  methods may be overloaded. This means that a class may have
multiple methods with the same name - of necessity they must have a
different signature. These methods have nothing to do with each other. 

<P>
Overloading is very convenient - it permits the programmer to use a
method name for some abstract concept and than provide instantiations
of that concept for different parameter types through different
overloaded methods with the same name. The name <TT>search</TT> is overloaded in 
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#table:NQueens-Board">2.1</A>, for instance.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00311330000000000000">
Access control</A>
</H4>
The qualifiers <TT>private, public, protected</TT> may be used to limit
access to a method. <TT>private</TT> methods may be accessed only by code
in the same class. <TT>public</TT> methods can be accessed from any
code. <TT>protected</TT> methods can only be accessed in the same class
or its subclasses. If no qualifier is provided, a method can be
accessed by code in the same package (it is said to be <EM>package protected</EM>).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00311400000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:x10-basic-constructor"></A>
<BR>
Constructors
</H3>

<P>
A class may specify zero or more <EM>constructors</EM>. For instance:

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
def this() { this(8);}
def this(N:Long) { this.N=N;}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
Constructors may be overloaded just like methods.  The
qualifiers <TT>private, public, protected</TT> may be used to limit access
to a constructor.

<P>
Instances of a class are created by invoking constructors using the
<TT>new</TT> expression:
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
new Board(q, k)
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>
The compiler declares an error if it cannot find a constructor for the
specified class with the same number of formal arguments such that the
formal type of each argument is a supertype of the type of each actual
argument.

<P>
If a class does not have a constructor an <EM>implicit</EM> constructor
is created. If the class has no properties then the implicit
constructor is of the form: 
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="74" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
def this() {}
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>
If the class has properties <TT>x1:T1</TT>, ..., <TT>xn:Tn</TT> then the
implicit constructor is of the form:
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
def this(x1:T1,...,xn:Tn) {
property(x1,...,xn);
}
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00312000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:x10-basic-structs"></A>
<BR>
Structs
</H2>
An object is typically represented through <EM>handles</EM>, indirect references to
a contiguous chunk of data on the heap. The space allocated
for an object typically consists of space for its fields and space for
a <EM>header</EM>. A header contains some bytes of data that represent
meta-information about the object, such as a reference to the table of
methods used to implement virtual dispatching on the object.  X10 also permits
the definition of <EM>structs</EM>, which are different.

<P>
A <TT>struct</TT> is a ``header-less'' object. It can be represented by
exactly as much memory as is necessary to represent the fields of the
struct (modulo alignment constraints) and with its methods compiled to
``static'' methods.  This is accomplished by imposing certain
restrictions on structs (compared to objects).  A <TT>struct</TT>
definition is just like a <TT>class</TT> definition except that it is
introduced by the keyword <TT>struct</TT> rather than by <TT>  class</TT>.  Like a class, a struct may define zero or more fields,
constructors and methods and may implement zero or more
interfaces. However, a struct does not support inheritance; it may not
have an <TT>extends</TT> clause. A struct may not be recursive: that
is, there can be no cycles in the graph whose nodes are struct
definitions and whose edges from <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.png"
 ALT="$a$"> to <IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.png"
 ALT="$b$"> record that the struct <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.png"
 ALT="$a$">
has a field of type (struct) <IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img14.png"
 ALT="$b$">.  

<P>
For instance the struct:

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img15.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
package examples;
public struct Complex(re:Double, im:Double){}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
defines a <TT>Complex</TT> struct, instances of which can be
represented by  exactly two doubles. An <TT> Array[Complex]</TT> with
<TT>N</TT> elements can be implemented (in the Native backend) with a
block of memory containing <TT>2*N</TT> doubles, with each <TT>Complex</TT>
instance inlined.  

<P>
X10  does not support any notion of a reference to a struct. 
Structs are passed by value. Equality <TT>==</TT> on structs is defined as
point-wise equality on the fields of the struct. Further, structs are
immutable; no syntax is provided to update fields of a struct in
place.  While these decisions simplify the language, they make it
awkward to express certain kinds of code, hence mutability and
references to structs may be introduced in future versions of the
language. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00313000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:x10-basic-functions"></A><A NAME="sec:x10-basics-functions"></A>
<BR>
Function literals
</H2>
X10 permits the definition of functions via literals. 
Such a literal consists of a parameter list, followed optionally by a
return type, followed by <TT>=&gt;</TT>, followed by the body (an
expression).

<P>
For instance the function that takes an argument <TT>i</TT> that is an <TT>Int</TT> and returns
<TT>old(i)</TT> if <TT>i &lt; n</TT> and <TT>newItem</TT> otherwise, is written as:
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img16.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
(i:Int) =&gt; (i &lt; n ? old(i) : newItem)
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>
The type of this value is <TT>(Int)=&gt;Int</TT>. Note that the return type is inferred in the above definition. We could also have written it explicitly as:
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="228" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img17.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
(i:Int):Int =&gt; (i &lt; n ? old(i) : newItem)
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>

<P>
For instance:
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="291" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img18.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
(a:Int) =&gt; a // the identity function on Int's
(a:Int, b:Int):Int =&gt; a &lt; b ? a : b // min function
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>
Above, the type of the first value is <TT>(Int)=&gt;Int</TT>, the type of
functions from <TT>Int</TT> to <TT>Int</TT>. The type of the second is
<TT>(Int,Int)=&gt;Int</TT>. 

<P>
A function is permitted to access immutable variables defined outside
its body (such functions are sometimes called closures). Note that the
immutable variable may itself contain an object with mutable state.

<P>
The return type can often be omitted  - it is inferred to be the

If <TT>x</TT> is a  function value of type <TT>(S1, ..., Sn) =&gt; T</TT>, and

<P>
The statement
 <TT>d.f=e</TT> evaluates <TT>d</TT> to determine an object <TT>o</TT>. This

 evluation and body execution repeats. Thus the loop terminates only
 when the condition evaluates to false.

<P>
A while loop may be labeled <TT>l: while (c) S</TT> (just as any other
 statement). The body of a <TT>while</TT> loop may contain the statements
 <TT>continue l;</TT> and <TT>break l;</TT>. The first causes control to
 jump to the top of the loop labeled <TT>l</TT>, i.e. the rest of the

For loops.</A>
</H3>
X10  supports the usual sort of <TT>for</TT> loop.
The body of a <TT>for</TT> loop
may contain <TT>break</TT> and <TT>continue</TT> statements just like <TT>while</TT> loops.

<P>
Here is an example of an explicitly enumerated for loop:

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="90" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img19.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
def sum0(a:Rail[Long]):Long {
var result:Long=0;
for (var x:Long=0; x &lt; a.size; ++x)
result += a(x);
return result;
}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
X10  also supports enhanced for loops.
The for loop may take an index specifier <TT> v in r</TT>, where <TT> r</TT>
is any value that implements <TT> x10.lang.Iterable[T]</TT> for some type
<TT> T</TT>. The body of the loop is executed once for every value
generated by <TT> r</TT>, with the value bound to <TT> v</TT>. 

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="206" HEIGHT="90" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
def sum1(a:Rail[Long]):Long {
var result:Long=0;
for (v in a)
result += v;
return result;
}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
Of particular interest is <TT> LongRange</TT>. The expression <TT> e1
  .. e2</TT> produces an instance of <TT> LongRange</TT> from <TT> l</TT> to <TT>
  r</TT> if <TT> e1</TT> evaluates to <TT> l</TT> and <TT> e2</TT>
evaluates to <TT> r</TT>. On iteration it enumerates all the values (if
any) from <TT> l</TT> to <TT> r</TT> (inclusive). Thus we can sum the numbers
from <TT> 0</TT> to <TT> N</TT>:

\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
One can iterate over multiple dimensions at the same time using <TT>  Region</TT>. A <TT>Region</TT> is a data-structure that compactly
represents a set of <EM>points</EM>. For instance, the region <TT>  Region.make(0..5, 1..6)</TT> is a 2-d region of points <TT>(x,y)</TT> where <TT>x</TT>
ranges over <TT>0..5</TT> and <TT>y</TT> over <TT>1..6</TT>. (The bounds are
inclusive.) The natural iteration order for a region is
lexicographic. Thus one can sum the coordinates of all points in a
given rectangle:

for ([x,y] in R) result += x + y;
return result;
}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
Here the syntax <TT>[x,y]</TT> is said to be <EM>destructuring syntax</EM>;
it destructures a 2-d point into its coordinates <TT>x</TT> and <TT>  y</TT>. One can write <TT>p[x,y]</TT> to bind <TT>p</TT> to the entire point.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00320500000000000000">
Throw statement.</A>
</H3> X10  has a non-resumptive exception
  model. This means that an exception can be thrown at any point in
  the code.  Starting with X10  2.3.0, exceptions may be either
  <EM>checked</EM> or <EM>unchecked</EM> to more closely match the Java
  programming model for exceptions. Checked exceptions will be
  subclasses of <TT>x10.lang.CheckedException</TT>; if a method throws
  such an exception then it must declare that it does so with a
  <TT>throws</TT> clause (placed after the return type of the method,
  if any, and the body of the method).

<P>
Throwing an exception causes the call stack to be unwound until a
catcher can be found (see below). If no catcher can be found the
exception is thrown to the closest dyamically enclosing <TT>finish</TT>
surrounding the throw point.

Try catch statement.</A>
</H3> A <TT>try/catch/finally</TT> statement works
  just as in Java. It permits exceptions to be caught (through a <TT>    catch</TT> clause) and computation resumed from the point of
  capture. A <TT>finally</TT> clause specifies code that must be run
  whenever control exits the <TT>try</TT> block - regardless of whether

Types
</H1>

<P>
X10  is a statically type-checked language. This means that
  the compiler checks the type of each expression, and ensures that
  the operations performed on an expression are those that are
  permitted by the type of the expression.  

<P>
The name <TT>C</TT> of a class or interface is the most basic form of a type in
X10. X10  also supports

<UL>
<LI><EM>generic types</EM> (e.g.
<TT>Array[Int]</TT>) that take types as parameters, 
</LI>
<LI><EM>constrained types</EM> (e.g. <TT>Array{self.rank==1}</TT>)
  that specify an additional constraint on the properties of the base
  type, 
</LI>
<LI><EM>nested types</EM> (e.g. <TT>MyArray[T].Reducer</TT>
</LI>
<LI><EM>functional type</EM> (e.g. <TT>(Int)=&gt;Int</TT>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
A type specifies a set of members (fields, methods,
constructors) that are defined on expressions of that type.

<P>
The availability of members of a type also depends on the
accessibility relation. That is, a member of a type may be defined
but not accessible (e.g. it is marked <TT>private</TT>).

<P>
A variable of a type <TT>S</TT> can only be assigned values whose
static type <TT>T</TT> is the same as <TT>S</TT> or is a <EM>subtype</EM>
of <TT>S</TT>.  

<P>
A type <TT>C</TT> is a subtype of type <TT>E</TT> if there is some
type <TT>D</TT> such that 
<TT>C</TT> is a subtype of <TT>D</TT> and
<TT>D</TT> is a subtype of <TT>E</TT>.

<P>
If (class or interface) <TT>C[X1,...,Xm]</TT> <TT>extends</TT> or 
<TT>implements</TT> type <TT>D[S1,..., Sn]</TT> (for <TT>m</TT> and
<TT>n</TT> non-negative integers) then for every
mapping <TT>A</TT> from type variables to types, the type obtained by applying 
<TT>A</TT> to <TT>C[X1,...,Xm]</TT> is a subtype of the type obtained by
applying <TT>A</TT> to <TT>D[S1,...,Sn]</TT>.

<P>
A constrained type <TT>C{c}</TT> is a subtype of <TT>D{d}</TT> if
<TT>C</TT> is a subtype of <TT>D</TT> and <TT>c</TT> implies
<TT>d</TT>. 

<P>
A nested type <TT>A.B</TT> is a subtype of <TT>C.D</TT>  if 
<TT>A</TT> is the same as <TT>C</TT> and <TT>B</TT> is a subtype of
<TT>D</TT>.

<P>
A function type <TT>(A1,...,Am)=&gt;B</TT> is a subtype of 
<TT>(D1,...,Dn)=&gt;E</TT> if <TT>m=n</TT>, <TT>Di</TT> is a subtype of
<TT>Ai</TT> (for <TT>i</TT> in <TT>1..n</TT>) and <TT>B</TT> is a
subtype of <TT>E</TT>.

<BR>
Generic types
</H2>
X10  permits <EM>generic types</EM>. That is a class or interface may be declared parametrized by types:

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="75" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img23.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
class List[T] {
var item:T;
var tail:List[T]=null;
def this(t:T){item=t;}
}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
This specifies that the class definition actually specifies an
infinite family of classes, namely those obtained by replacing the type
parameter <TT>T</TT> with any concrete type. For instance, <TT>List[Int]</TT> is the class obtained by replacing <TT>T</TT> in the body
of the class with <TT>Int</TT>:

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="75" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img24.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
class List_Int {
var item:Int;
var tail:List_Int=null;
def this(t:Int){item=t;}
}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
Clearly generic types are very convenient - after all they let you
figure out the code of the class once, and then use it an unbounded
number of times ... in a type-safe fashion.

<P>
X10  types are available at runtime, unlike Java (which erases
them).
Therefore, Array[Int] and Array[Float] can be overloaded.
X10 does not have primitive types and Int etc. can be used to instantiate type parameters.
Bounds may be specified on type parameters and methods can be
invoked on variables whose type is that parameter, as long as those
methods are defined and accessible on the bound.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00332000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:x10-basic-constrained-types"></A>
<BR>
Constrained types
</H2>
Constrained types are a key innovation of X10.

<P>
A constrained type is of the form <TT>T{c}</TT> where <TT>T</TT> is a
type and <TT>c</TT> is a <TT>Boolean</TT> expression of a restricted
kind. <TT>c</TT> may contain references to the special variable
<TT>self</TT>, and to any final variables visible at its point of
definition. 

<P>
Such a type is understood as the set of all entities <TT>o</TT> which
are of type <TT>T</TT> and satisfy the constraint <TT>c</TT> when
<TT>self</TT> is bound to <TT>o</TT>.

<P>
The permitted constraints include the predicates <TT>==</TT> and
<TT>!=</TT>.  These predicates may be applied to constraint terms. A
constraint term is either a final variable visible at the point of
definition of the constraint, or the special variable <TT>self</TT> or
of the form <TT>t.f</TT> where <TT>f</TT> names a field, and <TT>t</TT> is 
(recursively) a constraint term. In a term <TT>self.p</TT> <TT>p</TT> must
name a property of <TT>self</TT>. 

<P>
Examples:

<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="378" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img25.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
Matrix[Int]{self.I==100, self.J==200} // 100 x 200 matrix
Matrix[Int]{self.I==self.J} // the type of square matrices.
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>

<P>
Constraints may also include occurrences of user-defined
predicates. See [<A
 HREF="node6.html#x10-lang-spec">9</A>] for details.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00333000000000000000">
Type definitions</A>
</H2>

<P>
A type definition permits a simple name to be supplied for a
complicated type, and for type aliases to be defined. A type
definition consists of a name, an optional list of type parameters, an
optional list of (typed arguments), an ``<TT>=</TT>'' symbol, followed by
a type in which the type parameters and arguments may be used.

<P>
For instance the type definition:

<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="353" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img26.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennoindent}
public static type boolean(b:Boolean) = Boolean{self==b};
\end{xtennoindent}">
<BR>
permits the expression <TT>boolean(true)</TT> to be used as
shorthand the type <TT>Boolean{self==true}</TT>. 

<P>
X10 permits top-level type definitions. A type definition with
principal name <TT>N</TT> must be defined in the file
<TT>N.x10</TT>.  This file may contain other declarations as well,
or may contain just the type definition.
Example:

<BR>
