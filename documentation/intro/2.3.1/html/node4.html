<H1><A NAME="SECTION00400000000000000000"></A><A NAME="chap:apgas"></A>
<BR>
The APGAS model
</H1>

<P>
In this chapter, we cover the APGAS constructs in X10  v2.3.1.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00410000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:async"></A>
<BR>
Async
</H1>
The fundamental concurrency construct in X10  is <TT>async</TT>:

<P>
<PRE>
Stmt ::= async Stmt
</PRE>

<P>
The execution of <TT>async S</TT> may be thought of as creating a new
<EM>activity</EM> to execute <TT>S</TT> and returning immediately. The newly
created activity runs in parallel with the current activity and has
access to the same heap of objects as the current activity. Thus an
X10  computation may have many concurrent activities ``in flight``
at the same time. Activities communicate with each other by reading
and writing shared variables, e.g. fields of objects that both have
access to.

<P>
An activity may be thought of as a very light-weight thread of
execution. This means that the statement <TT>S</TT> may in fact contain
just a few instructions, e.g. reading the value of a variable,
performing some computation and then writing the value of a
variable. There is no restriction on the statement <TT>S</TT> - it may
contain any other construct (including other <TT>async</TT>s). In
particular, activities may be long-running - indeed they may run for
ever. In particular they make invoke recursive methods. Hence an
activity is associated with its own control stack.

<P>
Activities (unlike threads in Java) are not named. There is no runtime
object corresponding to an activity that is visible to user
programs. This permits the implementation the freedom to actually <EM>  not</EM> create a separate activity for each <TT>async</TT> at runtime as
long as the semantics of the language are not violated. For instance,
the compiler may decide to translate the program fragment: 

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="27" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img29.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
async { f.x=1;}
f.y=2;
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
to

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img30.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
f.x=1;
f.y=2;
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
This is called ``inlining'' an activity. It becomes much
harder for a compiler to inline if activities can have names - for,
to inline the activity the compiler will need to figure out that the
name is not used later.  

<P>
Activities cannot be interrupted or aborted once they are in
flight. They must proceed to completion.  

<P>
In <TT>async S</TT>, the code in <TT>S</TT> is permitted to refer to
immutable variables defined in the lexically enclosing scope. This is
extremely convenient when writing code. 

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00410010000000000000">
Local vs Global termination</A>
</H4>
Because an activity may spawn further activities, we distinguish
between <EM>local termination</EM> and <EM>global termination</EM>. We say
that an activity <TT>async S</TT> has locally terminated if <TT>S</TT> has
terminated. We say that it has <EM>globally terminated</EM> if it has
locally terminated and further any activities spawned during its
execution have themselves (recursively) globally terminated. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00420000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:finish"></A>
<BR>
Finish
</H1>
<TT>finish</TT> is a construct that converts global termination to local termination.

<P>
Using <TT>async</TT> we can specify that the elements of a rail should be doubled in parallel by:

<P>

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="354" HEIGHT="73" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img31.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
// Initialize the i'th element to i.
val a:Rail[Int] = new Ra...
...ry element of the array
for(i in 0..(a.size-1))
async a(i) *= 2;
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
Consider now what happens if we attempt to read the value of a location:

<P>

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="354" HEIGHT="88" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img32.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
// Initialize the i'th element to i.
val a:Rail[Int] = new Ra...
....size-1))
async a(i) *= 2;
Console.OUT.println(''a(1)='' + a(1));
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
Will it print out <TT>1</TT> or <TT>2</TT>? We cannot say! The activity
executing <TT>a(1) *= 2</TT> may not have terminated by the time the
current activity starts executing the print statement!

<P>
This is a fundamental problem. The programmer needs a mechanism for
specifying <EM>ordering</EM> of computations. To this end we introduce
the <TT>finish</TT> statement:

<P>
<PRE>
Stmt ::= finish Stmt
</PRE>

<P>
An activity executes <TT>finish S</TT> by executing <TT>S</TT> and then
waiting until all activities spawned during the execution of <TT>S</TT>
(transitively) terminate. Simple, but powerful!

<P>
To ensure proper termination of an X10  program, the <TT>main</TT>
method is executed within a <TT>finish</TT>. Thus the program terminates
only when the <TT>main</TT> method globally terminates. This property
ensures that for every activity created during program execution there
is a corresponding <TT>finish</TT> statement that will be notified of its
termination.  We say the activity tree is <EM>rooted</EM>.

<P>
We can now write our program as follows:

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="354" HEIGHT="88" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img33.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
// Initialize the i'th element to i.
val a:Rail[Int] = new Ra...
....size-1))
async a(i) *= 2;
Console.OUT.println(''a(1)='' + a(1));
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
and be guaranteed that the output will be <TT>2</TT>.  Notice
that little needs to change in the program - we just add <TT>finish</TT>
and <TT>async</TT> at the right place!

<P>
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#table:fib">3.1</A> shows how the Fibonacci program can be written
in parallel. It uses an idiom that is of interest in many other
settings. The natural functional way to write <TT>fib</TT> is through a recursive function call:

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img34.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
def fib(n:Int):Int = (n &lt;=2)? 1:( fib(n-1)+fib(n-2) );
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
The value is returned on the activity's stack. However, we
are interested in running <TT>fib</TT> in parallel, and hence we will
want a way by which multiple activities can invoke multiple <TT>fib</TT>
calls, each in their own stack. X10  does not permit the call stack
of one activity to be shared by another, or the code running during
the execution of an activity to read/write the local variables in a
stack frame of another activity.<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="#foot1272"><SUP>3.1</SUP></A>
<P>
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#table:fib">3.1</A> presents a slightly more verbose Fibonacci
program that makes explicit the interaction of activities through
objects on the heap. A heap object is created for each recursive
invocation of <TT>fib</TT>. The object has a single field which initially
contains the input argument to the call, and on return contains the
result of the call.

<P>
Note that the program illustrates that during execution <TT>finish</TT>
and <TT>async</TT> may be scoped arbitrarily: the body of an <TT>async</TT>
can contain <TT>finish</TT> statements, and the body of a <TT>finish</TT>
can contain <TT>async</TT> statements. This interplay is at the heart of
the expressiveness of the <TT>async</TT>/<TT>finish</TT> model.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00421000000000000000">
The rooted exception model</A>
</H2>

<P>
X10  supports a <EM>rooted exception model</EM>. Any exception thrown
inside an activity can be caught and handled within the activity by
executing a <TT>try/catch</TT> statement. What happens if there is no
<TT>try/catch</TT>? 

<P>
The rooted model offers an answer. Since every activity has a
governing <TT>finish</TT>, we let the exception propagate up from the
activity to the governing <TT>finish</TT>.  When executing a <TT>finish
S</TT> statement, all exceptions thrown by activities spawned during the
execution of <TT>S</TT> are accumulated at the <TT>finish</TT> statement. If
at least one exception has been received at the <TT>finish</TT>
statement, then it throws a <TT>MultipleExceptions</TT> exception with
the set of exceptions as an argument. This ensures that no exception
gets dropped on the floor (unlike Java).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00430000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:atomic"></A>

Atomic
</H1>

<P>
Consider a parallel version of the Histogram program:

<P>

<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="249" HEIGHT="90" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img36.png"
 ALT="\begin{xtennum}[]
def hist(a:Rail[Int], b: Rail[Int]) {
finish for(i in 0..(a.size-1)) async {
val bin = a(i)% b.size;
b(bin)++;
}
}
\end{xtennum}">
<BR>

<P>
However, this program is <EM>incorrect</EM>! Why? Multiple activities
executing <TT>b(bin)++</TT> may interfere with each other! The operation
<TT>d++</TT> is not an <EM>atomic</EM> operation.

<P>
An atomic operation is an operation that is performed in a single step
with respect to all other activities in the system (even though the
operation itself might involve the execution of multiple
statements). X10  provides the <EM>conditional atomic statement</EM>
as a basic statement:

<P>
<PRE>
Stmt ::= when (c) Stmt
</PRE>

<P>
Here <TT>c</TT> is a condition, called the <EM>guard</EM> of the
statement. An activity executes <TT>when (c) S</TT> atomically - in a
single step - provided that the condition <TT>c</TT> is
satisfied. Otherwise it blocks (waiting for the condition to be true).

<P>
The conditional atomic statement is an extremely powerful
construct. It was introduced in the 1970s by Per Brinch Hansen and
Tony Hoare under the name ``conditional critical region''. This is the
only construct in X10  that permits one activity to block waiting
for some other set of activities to establish some condition on shared
variables.

<P>
This construct has an important special case. The statement
<TT>atomic S</TT> is just shorthand for <TT>when (true) S</TT>.

<P>
Since the construct is so powerful, it is subject to several
conditions for ease of implementation.

<UL>
<LI>The condition <TT>c</TT> must be <EM>sequential</EM>,
    <EM>non-blocking</EM>, and <EM>local</EM>. That is, it must not spawn new
    activities (contain a <TT>async</TT> or <TT>finish</TT>), it must not
    itself call a <TT>when</TT>, and it must not access remote locations
    (contain an <TT>at</TT>).
</LI>
<LI>The statement <TT>S</TT> must be also be <EM>sequential</EM>,
    <EM>non-blocking</EM>, and <EM>local</EM>.
</LI>
<LI>The condition <TT>c</TT> may be evaluated an arbitrary number of
    times by the X10 scheduler to determine if it returns true.
    Therefore it should be side-effect free and as simple as possible. 
</LI>
</UL>
The first two restrictions are enforced dynamically: while executing
either the condition or the statement if the program attempts to
execute a <TT>async</TT>, <TT>at</TT>, <TT>finish</TT>, or <TT>when</TT> then an
<TT>IllegalOperationException</TT> will be raised.  The last restriction
is currently not enforced by X10 . 

<P>
The Histogram problem can now be solved correctly:

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00440000000000000000"></A><A NAME="sec:places"></A>
<BR>
Places
</H1>
We come now to a central innovation of X10, the notion of <EM>places</EM>. Places permit the programmer to explicitly deal with notions
of <EM>locality</EM>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00441000000000000000">
Motivation</A>
</H2>
Locality issues arise in three primary ways. 

<P>
First, consider you are writing a program to deal with enormous
amounts of data - say terabytes of data, i.e. thousands of
gigabytes. Now you may not have enough main memory on a single node to
store all this data - a single node will typically have tens of
gigabytes of main storage. So therefore you will need to run your
computation on a <EM>cluster</EM> of nodes: a collection of nodes
connected to each other through some (possibly high-speed)
interconnect.  That is, your single computation will actually involve
the execution of several operating system level processes, one on each
node. Unfortunately, acccessing a memory location across a network is
typically orders of magnitude slower (i.e. has higher <EM>latency</EM>)
than accessing it from a register on the local core. Further, the rate
at which data can be transferred to local memory (<EM>bandwidth</EM>) is
orders of magnitude higher than the rate at which it can be
transferred to memory across the cluster.

<P>
As with implicit parallelism, one could try to write extremely clever
compilers and runtimes that try to deal with this memory wall
implicitly. Indeed, this is the idea behind <EM>distributed shared
memory</EM> (DSM). The entire memory of a collection of processes is
presented to the programmer as a single shared heap. Any activity can
read and write any location in shared memory. However, there are no
efficient implementations of DSM available today. The primary
conceptual issue is that the programmer has lost control over
decisions that can have orders of magnitude impact on performance of
their code. When looking at a single assignment statement <TT>a.f=e</TT>,
the programmer has no way of knowing whether this is going to take
dozens of cycles or millions of cycles.

<P>
A second primary motivation arises from heterogeneity. Computer
architects are looking to boost computational power by designing
different kinds of specialized cores, each very good at particular
kinds of computations. In general, these <EM>accelerators</EM> interact
with the main processor at arm's length.

<P>
Two primary cases in point are the Toshiba-Sony-IBM Cell Broadband
Engine (``Cell processor'' for short), and general-purpose graphical
processing engines (GPGPUs for short), from vendors such as NVidia and
AMD. These provide an enormous boost in computational power for
particular kinds of regular loops at the cost of introducing
specialized hardware.

<P>
For instance, the Cell provides eight specialized processors (SPEs) on
a single chip, connected to each other through a high-speed (on-chip)
bus. These processors may execute many instructions in parallel (they
have ``single instruction multiple data'', SIMD,
instructions). However, data needs to be explicitly transfered from
main memory to a local cache on each SPE, operated upon, and then
transfered back.

<P>
The third motivation is similar to the second, but involves only
homogeneous cores. Multiple cores may share precious resources, such
as L1 and L2 cache. To improve performance, it may make sense to <EM>bind</EM> activities to particular cores, in particular to force certain
groups of activities to work on the same cores so that they can
amortize the cost of cache misses (because they are operating on the
same data). Or it may make sense to bind them to <EM>different</EM> cores
that do not share an L2 cache so that the execution of one does not
pollute the cache lines of the other.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00442000000000000000">
The <TT>at</TT> construct</A>
</H2>

<P>
A <EM>place</EM> in X10  is a collection of data and activities that
operate on that data. A program is run on a fixed number of
places. The binding of places to hardware resources (e.g. nodes in a
cluster, accelerators) is provided externally by a configuration file,
independent of the program. 

<P>
Programs are typically written to operate on any number of places. The
number of places in a particular run of the program can be queried
through <TT>Place.MAX_PLACES</TT>. 

<P>
In X10  v2.3.1   all places are uniform. In future versions of the
language we will support heterogeneity by permitting different kinds
of places, with the ability to check the attributes of a place
statically, and hence write code that depends on the <EM>kind</EM> of
place it is running on.

<P>
The primary construct for exposing places to the programmer is:
<PRE>
Stmt ::= at (p) Stmt
</PRE>

<P>
An activity executing <TT>at (p) S</TT> suspends execution in the current
place.  The object graph <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img39.png"
 ALT="$G$"> at the current place whose roots are all the
variables <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img40.png"
 ALT="$V$"> used in <TT>S</TT> is serialized, and transmitted to place
<TT>p</TT>, deserialized (creating a graph <IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img41.png"
 ALT="$G'$"> isomorphic to <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img39.png"
 ALT="$G$">), an
environment is created with the variables <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img40.png"
 ALT="$V$"> bound to the
corresponding roots in <IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img41.png"
 ALT="$G'$">, and <TT>S</TT> executed at <TT>p</TT> in
this environment.   On local termination of
<TT>S</TT>, computation resumes after <TT>at (p) S</TT> in the original
location. The object graph is not automatically transferred back to
the originating place when <TT>S</TT> terminates: <EM>any updates made
  to objects copied   by an <TT>at</TT> will not be reflected in the
  original object graph</EM>. 

<P>
The <TT>at</TT> statement is a reminder to the programmer that at this
point communication may potentially happen across the
network. Therefore the programmer should be aware of what values will
be transmitted from the source to the destination place and also be
aware that any mutations to objects during the execution of <TT>S</TT>
will only be visible at <TT>p</TT>

<P>
Because of this ability to shift the current place, <TT>at</TT>
is said to be a <EM>place-shifting</EM> operation. It is the only
control construct related to places in X10.

<P>
The indexical constant <TT>here</TT> can be used to determine the current
place.

<P>
It is also possible to use <TT>at</TT> as an expression to do a
computation and return a value to the originating place.
<PRE>
Expr ::= at (p) { S; E } 
Expr ::= at (p) E
</PRE>
In this variant of <TT>at</TT>, the value of <TT>E</TT> is serialized from
<TT>p</TT> back to the originating place and used as the value of the
<TT>at</TT> expression.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00443000000000000000">
GlobalRef</A>
</H2>

<P>
Of course the abstraction of a partitioned global address space
without some means of actually referring to objects in a different
partition would not be of much use.  Therefore the X10  standard
library provides the <TT>GlobalRef</TT> struct in the <TT>x10.lang</TT>
package. Using GlobalRef, the programmer can easily create cross-place
references by capturing a GlobalRef within an <TT>at</TT> statement.

<P>
The core API of <TT>GlobalRef</TT> is shown below. It has two operations:
a constructor to create a <TT>GlobalRef</TT> to encapsulate an object and
a method to access the encapsulated object, which is constrained via a
method guard to only be applicable at the home <TT>Place</TT> of the
<TT>GlobalRef</TT>. 

<BR>

\par
/**

\end{xtennum}">
<BR>
To access the encapsulated object, the programmer uses <TT>at</TT> to
place-shift to the ref's <TT>home</TT>:

<BR>
In X10 , the programmer must explicitly place-shift using <TT>at</TT>
to access an object that lives in another <TT>Place</TT>. Requiring an
explicit <TT>at</TT> is a design choice that was made to highlight for
the programmer that at this point communication may potentially happen
across the network.

Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#table:gradv">3.3</A> shows some additional operations defined on
the <TT>GlobalRef</TT> struct.  These functions encapsulate more
efficient implemenetations of common idiomatic usages of
<TT>GlobalRef</TT>.

Another useful abstraction for a partitioned global address space is
that of an abstract reference that can be resolved to a different
object in each partition of the address space.  Such a reference
should be both efficiently transmittable from one <TT>Place</TT> to
another and also be efficiently resolvable to its target object in each
<TT>Place</TT>. A primary use of such an abstraction is the definition of
distributed data structures that need to keep a portion of their state
in each <TT>Place</TT>. In X10, the <TT>PlaceLocalHandle</TT> struct
in the <TT>x10.lang</TT> package provides such an abstraction.  Examples
of its usage can be found in virtually all of the programming examples
in the next part of this book.
